The format of *SwMakesHw* is somewhere between a blog, series of articles, and a book.  There will be a few differences from all of these formats: notably, we reserve the right to update any content at any time.  The pages of *SwMakesHw* are more like "chapters" than "posts" in this context.  Both software and hardware are ever-evolving fields, and both our perspective on best-practices, and the underlying industry realities will change over time.  Each page reflects our views as of its publication, and those views are subject to change with time.  The entire history of each page will be available in the *SwMakesHw* [source repository](https://github.com/HW21/SwMakesHw).  

*Software Makes Hardware* is also available on [Medium](https://medium.com/software-makes-hardware).
