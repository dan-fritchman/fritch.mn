Analogs most sacred cow

And why it’s time to put it down

The dinner party test 

I try to hold my understanding of ideas in my, or any other field to this test. 


There are 

# not zero value. less than zero value

Fill I the blanks rate something on a scale from x and y.  For nearly everyone, answers tend to be one to ten one to one hundred.  We tend to place the worst things near zero.  When then asked to rank things on these scales, we create a mental image that looks something like so

A number line, zero to infinity

Rank world leaders
Mussolini 1
Abraham Lincoln 10
Herbert Hoover 3
King George IV 2
Churchill 8

Rank basketball players
Me 5
Your grandmother 1
Kylie Irving 9
Kevin Durant 10

We have an easier time imagining things falling off the right side of the graph than the left.  If Irving is a 9 and Durant is a 10, is it fair to say that Michael Jordan is an 11 or a 15?  While this may no longer really be a ten point scale, it gets said all the time.   Spinal taps turning the volume up t 11.  

There’s a bias built into all oaf these numbers being greater than zero: it implies that each of items has some positive value.  

Our mental model goes something like this: on a scale of one to ten, the median world leader will be about a five.  The best we can think of is a ten, and the worst is aone.  Try to figure out some measure of distance between those things, and interpolate all the other points in between.

Its a lot less common to hear of things falling off the left side of this chart, and ranking below zero. 

This is the bias to expose: our expectation that everything is adding some positive quality to the world.  

For information, the lowest bar of value is simply is it true.  A more relevant bar is whether it was worth the effort required to acquire it.  Information has real costs, at minimum the opportunity cost of spending the time and effort gathering and remembering it could have been spent gathering and remembering some other piece of information.  

This is the zero level for the value of information: was it worth acquiring.  Does the benefit of knowing outweighs the cost of getting it.  There are an infinite number of true facts about the world which sit far below this threshold.  How many hairs are on my head?  How many were removed during my last hair cut.  What’s the correlation coefficient between the first letter of people’s last names, and the last letter of their occupation?  How many atoms were there in my last sneeze?  Were any of them also part of the sneezes of Churchill, Lincoln, or Mussolini?  At this moment, how many birds are in flight above earth?

These are all questions which we can, at least in principle, answer.  We don’t for the same reasons: the answers aren’t worth finding. 

Now, if we apply the ranking test to our favorite schematics, it might look something like so:

Nice op amp 10
An ok circuit 5
Really convoluted things 1

The really convoluted schematics do less than zero good.  They do material negative good, by obscuring information which could be false, but misleads us to believing it is true.  

On a more accurate scale, the convoluted schematics would be more negative than the nice ones are positive.  And 

For practitioners in the schematic arts: ask yourself this question, and try to answer it honestly.  Have you seen more of the good or bad kind?  In other words, have you come across more schematics who’s value is greater than zero, or less.

My own experience is clear: the overwhelming majority are worth less than zero.  And the negative ones tend to be more bad, than the positive ones tend to be good.  The convoluted schematics both outnumber and out crappify the good ones, both probably by an order of magnitude. 

## throw them all out?  Or just the bad ones?

Is this an argument to throw away all.

## what takes their place

Hdl updates

System vs silicon

There should not be a new hdl.  There should be 30.  Diversity of options is exactly what this space needs.  No one decries that there are too many Chinese restaurants, or too many barber shops, or even too many programming languages.  But a sliver of diversity in this space seems intolerable.  

My experience with layout designers is that they apply a strange test to their work, which they would not apply to any other aspect of their life.  If something is within the rules, they do it, and expect it to work perfectly.
