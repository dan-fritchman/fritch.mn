Why Analog Lost

Ethos 

My job, for most of my career, has been the design of the analog parts of overwhelmingly digital chips.  Apple mobile socs. 

Uses of analog and digital

Not the colloquial ones 

The relationship between Analog and digital parallels that between classical and quantum physics.  In principle, quantum physics in its full depth can explain why planes fly or crash, bridges stand or fall, and how balls roll along inclined planes.  Our only problem is applying it.  Even with even desire to create the quantum model of a Boeing 737, we would need far longer than the history of the universe - much less than the history of humanity - for it to compute a result, even on the worlds most advanced computers.  The quantum laws are principally applicable everywhere, they are only practically applicable in the case of the very small, in which their high resolution is not wasted amid a wash of complexity. 

Yet we manage to make bridges stand, and did so long before developing quantum mechanics.   Newton’s mechanics remain the applicable law of the physical land for regular sized things: humans, baseballs, airplanes, and bridges.  Things orders of magnitude larger - stars, galaxies - demand relativity.  Others orders smaller - electrons, atoms, and molecules - demand quantum mechanics. 

So it is with electronics.  The analog paradigm is to digital as quantum physics is to newton.  The digital view is more concise, more abstract, lower fidelity and far more efficient.  The analog views is far higher fidelity, in exchange for being far less efficient.  

Analog is little more than a wrapper around Maxwells equations and Newton’s mechanics.  

But there must be things that are only analog.  More accurately, there are things whose analysis only works when done from thebanalognoaradigm.  Just as Newtonian mechanics fail to describe electrons, digital mechanics fail to describe an op-amp, antenna 

There has been one person pushing a new wave of analog for years: George Dyson. 

Some GD quotes 

These are category errors.  There are no analog components and digital components to contrast here, only components and analog and digital ways of looking at them.  To the extent that it makes sense to call a thing an analog component, at best we might mean a component whose description only makes sense in the analog paradigm.  

Dyson seems to make these category errors everywhere he goes. 

More quotes, some Facebook stuff

At best this is misguided.  Facebook most certainly stores a social network very digitally.  Case in point, you can be friends with another Facebook user, or not.  You cannot be friends of level 13 versus level 99, much less level 3.14159.  Friendship, in facebooks context, is not only digital, it is binary.  There are two available states: friend and not.  Real life in this sense is analog.  Each of your friends come at different levels of breadth and depth, and perhaps each of these dimensions across a variety of topics, durations, or situations.  You might be great friends in a poker game, but complete strangers regarding relationships.  Friendship is also not necessarily symmetric.  One friend can rate a relationship as a 99, while her counterpart rates it as a 1. 

Even if you attempt to extract a quantitative multi level measure of friend-ness, perhaps for example a number of shared friends, conversations, or joint photos, Facebook would still store these quantities very digitally.  Even if they attempt to create a floating point representation of friend-ness - perhaps an elaborate weighted combination of the per-time rates of these quantities, the result would still be digital. 

GD seems to believe that analog will matter when we give up the design of our systems, and let the machines take over for us.
